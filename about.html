                Im a passionate Web Developer, Programming and developing web applications has become my daily inspiration to life.
                I'm inspired by the way how we humans have become so dependable on technologyy and the benefits that technologyy offers.
                I have always had a strong intrest in computers and little did i know that i would become a programmer too.
                <br>
                <br>

                The first programming language i taught myself was python. It was not easy at first but i grew to love the syntax as time went by.
                 After doing a hard research on the internet i came upon a decision that i want to become a web developer. It was boring at first as i stummbeld across HTML, but things became more interesting when i got to know CSS.
                 <br>
                 <br>

                 I'm from a privileged background where there are not too many opportunities. But since i have started programming
                 i have opened doors to everlasting opportunities towards my life. My goal is to become successful and become one of the best 
                 programmers in the world, perhaps i too can change and inspire the lives of future generations to come.
